We can observe Crop intensification in terms of both space and time dimensions under the inter-cropping system.</b></p>
            
            <p style="text-align: left; color: rgb(48, 28, 2);"><b> The major benefit of intercropping is it increases the production per unit area compared to single cropping through the effective use of resources, nutrients including water, and solar energy. Inter-cropping is preferred over sole cropping as a result of superior yield due to the efficient utilization of available resources.</b></p>

                <ol style="color: rgb(76, 4, 72);">
                    <li><i><b>Mixed Intercropping or Mixed Cropping:</b></i> Growing of two or more crops simultaneously on the same piece of land with no distinct row arrangement</li>
                    <li><i><b>Row Intercropping:</b></i> It is a kind of intercropping where different crops are grown at the same time in the same piece of land with a distinct row arrangement.</li>
                    <li><i><b>Patch intercropping:</b></i>In this method of intercropping, intercrops are grown in patches in the vacant spaces in the same piece of land. </li>
                    <li><i><b> Strip intercropping:</b></i>In this method, we will grow more than one crop in strips to allow independent cultivation in the same piece of land.</li>
                    <li><i><b>Relay Intercropping:</b></i> In relay intercropping intercrops were sown or planted when the main crops reach maturity but before harvesting of the base crop.</li>
                    <li><i><b> Parallel Intercropping:</b></i> In this method, both selected intercrop and main crops are with different growing habits. Hence, there will zero competition for the available resources. So, both crops can express their full yield potential.</li>
                    <li><i><b>Multi Storied Intercropping:</b></i>In multistoried intercropping crops with different heights were selected. Mostly this kind of intercropping is adopted in plantation crops. </li>
                    <li><i><b>  Alley Intercropping:</b></i>Alley cropping is a kind of agroforestry system where intercrops are grown in the alleys of trees and hedges etc.</li>
                    <li><i><b>  Guard Crops:</b></i>The main crop is grown in the center, where it is surrounded by hardy or thorny crops. Thus the main crop gets protection with the help of gourd crops.
                    Guard crops are mainly planted with a view to protecting the main crop. Guard crops are planted around the main crops in such a way to protect the main crop.</li>
                    <li><i><b>  Trap Crops: </b></i>Traps crops like marigold and mustard etc. are intercropped in between the main crop to trap various insect pests.</li>

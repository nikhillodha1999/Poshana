Terrestrial or aquatic plants may grow with their roots exposed to the nutritious liquid or in addition, the roots may be mechanically supported by an inert medium such as perlite, gravel, or other substrates.</b></p>

            <p style="color: rgb(76, 4, 72);"> 
                Hydroponics is a form of farming that uses a nutrient solution root medium, rather than soil, to grow plants. Also referred to as tank farming, hydroponic plant roots may simply hang in water containing a mixture of dissolved nutrients or be supported by an inert substrate growing medium. Often, the irrigation and fertilizing is performed mechanically in smaller spaces, and even vertically (known as vertical gardens), making it a more budget-friendly and labor-saving farming method. Vegetables like cucumbers and leafy greens like spinach are some of the most popular plants that are grown hydroponically, but gardeners can easily grow herbs or fruiting plants like strawberries, as well.

                        <li><i><b>Set-Up a Water Reservoir:</b></i> Create a reservoir in a bucket or basin filled with water and hydroponic fertilizer based on your plant's feeding requirements. This reservoir will sit beneath the tray holding your plant and growing medium.</li>
                        <li><i><b>Connect Wicks to the Growing Tray:</b></i> Connect one or two wicks through holes in the bottom of the growing tray. If you need to make holes in the growing tray, use a drill or screwdriver. The wicks will soak up water from the reservoir and draw it up to the growing medium in the tray.</li>
                        <li><i><b>Set Up a Growing Tray:</b></i>Set the growing medium in the tray, containing a seedling, above the water reservoir. Use a medium that won't drain too fast and will utilize the capillary action of the wick most effectively, such as vermiculite, perlite, and soilless mixes.</li>
                        <li><i><b>Set Up a Light Fixture:</b></i>If you're using natural light, skip this step. Otherwise, set up a light fixture above the growing tray. If using incandescent light bulbs, set them 24 inches from the plants. LED and fluorescent lights are not as hot; place them 6 and 12 inches, respectively, from the plants.</li>

                    Grown indoors in a geoponic (soil-based) platform, indoor vertical farming requires less natural resources and saves space in tight urban spaces. It uses less soil and water. In fact, indoor vertical farming uses 90% less water than traditional field farming. When compared to traditional farming, geoponic farming saves as much as 20 days’ from seeding to harvest, taking fewer days to grow, maintain and harvest vertical crops over a plant cycle.

                        Commercial vertical farming can help feed people in places where they potentially would not otherwise have access, as long as there are viable sources of water and light. For geoponic solutions, it’s very easy to grow food for the masses without any agricultural training. You could put up a vertical farm or container farm in the parking lot of any grocery store or restaurant chain. Then, reap the benefits: save more money on trucks and fuel than you’d spend on facilities and power to grow your own food.

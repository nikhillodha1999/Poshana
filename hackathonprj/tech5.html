        <p style="text-align: left; color: rgb(48, 28, 2);"><b> Permaculture is an approach to land management and settlement design that adopts arrangements observed in flourishing natural ecosystems. It includes a set of design principles derived using whole-systems thinking. It applies these principles in fields such as regenerative agriculture, town planning, rewilding, and community resilience. Permaculture originally came from "permanent agriculture". </b></p>
        <p style="text-align: left; color: rgb(48, 28, 2);"><b>But was later adjusted to mean "permanent culture", incorporating social aspects. The term was coined in 1978 by Bill Mollison and David Holmgren, who formulated the concept in opposition to modern industrialized methods instead adopting a more traditional or "natural" approach to agriculture.</b></p>

                <p>
                    The very first step is to get to know your yard over time, ideally a full year throughout all four seasons. Find out how much light, wind, and water it gets, and learn about the natural ecosystem, climate, and microclimate. Pay attention to how a slope affects rainwater runoff, where rainwater accumulates, and where the prevailing wind comes from.

                <p>
                    Divide your yard into zones. Plants that you visit the most, such as herbs for cooking, should be the closest to the house. The zone that is the farthest away is the one that needs the least care and attention.

                    Especially if your yard is small, think about how you can grow things vertically on trellises and other structures, both ornamentals and edibles.

                    <p>
                        When designing your permaculture garden, include as many native plants as possible but make sure they are indeed native to your area. Native plants have numerous benefits: they attract pollinators, provide food and shelter for wildlife, and they are much better adapted to your local climate than introduced species. They are also fairly disease- and drought-resistant.

                        <p>
                            A permaculture garden doesn’t draw strict borders between edibles and ornamentals and intersperses the two. Rhubarb does not necessarily need to be planted in the same location as your vegetables, and bee balm is well-placed in the midst of your vegetables because it’s a pollinator magnet.

                            <p>
                                To turn lawn, or any other area that is currently planted, into a permaculture garden, instead of digging it all up, practice sheet mulching. In this method, which is also called lasagna gardening, you cover the area with a thick layer of mulch and wait until the vegetation below the mulch has decomposed. This takes time and advance planning. Ideally, you would do sheet mulching in the late summer to early fall so it’s ready for planting the next spring. Sheet mulching requires less effort than digging up the soil and it disturbs the soil less, plus it returns the decomposed plant material right back to the soil, which is one of the principles of permaculture.

                                    Instead of digging up an entire patch of grass, remove an area just big enough to plant a tree or shrub. This is called spot planting.

                                            In permaculture, improving the soil quality is an ongoing process. Add organic amendments to the soil whenever you have them, utilizing decomposed plant waste.

                                                Plant natives that don’t need watering. Collect water in rain barrels and create a rain garden. Use efficient and sustainable watering methods such as drip irrigation and soaker hoses.
